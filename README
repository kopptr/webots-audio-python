This project adds audio device support for Webots in the Python environment.

The current version of Webots (6.4.4) contains support for the simulated
Microphone and Speaker devices in the C language, but does not contain support
when using other languages. This package adds support for python (and in doing
so, C++).

Webots is a trademark of Cyberbotics Ltd.
